# Traffic_management_simulation

Urbanization has led to a rapid increase in vehicular traffic, intensifying congestion issues across city intersections. Conventional traffic signal systems, which operate on fixed timers, often fail to accommodate varying traffic densities throughout the day. This results in increased wait times, fuel wastage, and elevated pollution levels. To address these inefficiencies, this project presents a Smart Traffic Management System developed using Python and Pygame, simulating an adaptive signal control mechanism.

The system emulates a four-way traffic junction where each signal dynamically adjusts its green light duration based on real-time vehicle density per lane. Vehicles are categorized (cars, buses, trucks, bikes, and rickshaws), and signal timing is calculated by considering the average crossing time for each type. The simulation tracks performance metrics such as the number of vehicles passed, signal efficiency, and average waiting time per vehicle. This project provides a foundational framework to test and analyze intelligent traffic control logic. While currently simulation-based, it can be extended by integrating computer vision models like YOLO or IoT sensors for real-world deployment, making it a scalable solution toward smarter and greener urban mobility.
